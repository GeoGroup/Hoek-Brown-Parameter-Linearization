The program is a free Matlab software dedicated to
the estimation of Equivalent Tunnelling Mohr-Coulomb
Strength Parameters for Generalized Hoek-Brown Media.


This code is freely distributed for use in an academic and
research framework. The humble programmer hastens to say
that he cannot be held responsible for any malfunction
of the software and related consequences. However, he may
provide assistance if needed and kindly asked.


The theoretical background is developped in the journal
paper entitled "Robust Equivalent Tunnelling Mohr-Coulomb
Strength Parameters for Generalized Hoek-Brown Media", by
Meng et al and to be published in European Journal of 
Environmental and Civil Engineering.


Code-users are encouraged to refer to this paper
for any theoretical concern. Besides, we kindly require
this articleto be cited if this software is to be used in any
published work.
